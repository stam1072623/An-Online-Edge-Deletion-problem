# An-Online-Edge-Deletion-problem
There is given an undirected graph G -- (V, E) from which edges are deleted one at a time and about which questions of the type, "Are the vertices u and v in the same connected component?" have to be answered "on-line."

This prorgam is a simplified implementation of the Even and Shiloach algorithm for the Online Deletion Problem. In the repository I include the original article that describes the problem, the code of the solution, and a python script that can visualize the graphs that someone can produce while running the program.
